# HappyYou : May Happy Be With You

## About HappyYou

**HappyYou** is a journaling application that we hope will become your daily storytelling companion. With the slogan "May happy come to you," this app is designed to help you express the feelings and stories you're experiencing. Every time you share your thoughts or emotions through HappyYou, the app will provide an assessment of your mental state and offer recommendations based on the results.

## Background

Mental health is an increasingly crucial issue of our times. The Ipsos Global Health Service Monitor 2023 highlights a steady rise in global concern for mental health, emphasizing the growing awareness and urgent need for effective solutions to support mental well-being. This concern is particularly prevalent among young people aged 15 to 25, as mental disorders are more common in this age group. Providing targeted support and resources is essential to help them navigate these challenging years.

One powerful tool to support mental health is journaling. The seven key benefits of journaling include reducing anxiety, controlling emotions, overcoming depression, overcoming trauma, increasing self-confidence, strengthening memory, and achieving goals. By regularly expressing thoughts and feelings through journaling, individuals can significantly improve their mental well-being.

## Goal & Aim

Our goal is to address the critical issues people face today: pent-up emotions, unproductivity, and the need to express feelings, which can hinder personal growth and well-being. HappyYou aims to provide a comprehensive solution by creating a safe space for expressing emotions and offering activity ideas to stay productive. By doing so, we strive to help users effectively manage their mental health. HappyYou is designed to be more than just a digital diary; itâ€™s a supportive companion that aids in understanding and improving mental well-being through its unique features.
